        My love for beauty in all its forms have inspired me to become successful in both luxury retail as well as becoming a professional classical pianist. Being fully conscious that presentation is the key as well as one needs to be 100% focused at practise and on the stage, I worked diligently to balance these two completely opposite philosophies in life. My ultimate goal is to present to the world the beauty of Western classical music, a true gift that transcends all culture and religion, a true beauty that all gods have created.
