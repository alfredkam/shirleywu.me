    For those of you who want to learn to play the piano but don‘t want simplistic beginning books, the adult piano course is for older beginners. Though titled an adult course, it would work for junior high or high schoolers also. Level 1 starts right at the beginning, finding notes and introducing hand positions. Like the Complete Basic Course Levels, this series also introduces the chords earlier, enabling even beginners to play songs with chords rather than single note melodies. This series shares a number of songs with the Basic Course, but it moves a little faster, is not illustrated, and teaches in less simplistic terms. We no longer sell the supplemental books for this series; the levels listed below are simply the lesson books

    This easy step-by-step method emphasizes correct playing habits and note reading through interval recognition. Lesson Book Level 1A begins by teaching basic keyboard topography and fluent recognition of white key names in relation to black keys. It focuses on simple rhythms and prepares students for intervallic reading with entertaining songs that focus on “same,” “stepping up” and “stepping down.” It then introduces lines and space notes in treble and bass clefs, melodic and harmonic intervals of 2nds, 3rds, 4ths and 5ths, and graduates to reading on the grand staff. It also introduces the flat and sharp signs.
