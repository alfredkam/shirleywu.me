Shirley Wu began her piano lessons at Wuhan Academy of Music when she was 4 years old. Every Saturday, for the next 9 years or so, her mother, a former university professor and an amateur violinist, brought Shirley to piano lessons. Shirley’s grandfather, very proficient in the Chinese traditional art Tai Chi and Chinese chess, have always taught the family the importance of arts in a person’s life. When Shirley was 13, her family immigrated to Montreal, Canada. Shirley attended F.A.C.E. (Fine Art Core Education) school, a famous bilingual arts high school in Montreal where she practised as much piano as she could and became deeply attached to this instrument. Shirley decided to make this her career, she graduated from classical piano performance and pure science double D.E.C. from Vanier College in 2009 and classical piano performance from McGill University in 2013.

Shirley’s former piano professors include Su Bin from Wuhan Academy of music, Julliard graduate Noraire Artinian (at Vanier College), Julia G
, Luba Z., Ilya P. and Martin K. (at McGill). She was also invited to attend Courchevel summer music festival in the French Alps where she studied with prestigious professor Christopher Elton from Royal Academy of Music UK.
</p><br>
<p>
In 2012, Shirley was hired as the pianist / assistant manager at Steinway Montreal for almost one year. She helped out with the Vladimir Horowitz piano while it was on exhibition in Montreal. This gave her the opportunity to broaden her connection in the classical music industry. Her former patrons include Transrex Inc. owner Francois Gelinas’s family, CMC competition sponsor Canimex foundation Mr. Roger Dubois’s family, the Piano Bolduc family etc.
</p><br><p>
As a performer, Shirley has performed in Tanna Schulich hall, Pollack hall, Salle Claude Champagne, Vanier Auditorium, Rialto theater, Westmount Senior Residence, St Laurent Church etc. Her enthusiasm about piano and classical music keeps influencing ones around her to become supporter of this almost dying art.
</p><br><p>
Shirley plans to pursue a Master degree of performance science at Royal College of Music in September 2015.
